    ssh hidproxy
    modprobe bluetooth bnep btbcm hci_uart

After the above, I'm getting:

    # bluetoothctl 
    Waiting to connect to bluetoothd...

Urg. Maybe https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/402623/waiting-to-connect-to-bluetoothd?

    modprobe btusb

Nope. In one terminal, run:

    /usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd

In another terminal:

    # bluetoothctl
    Agent registered
    [bluetooth]# list
    [bluetooth]# 

From https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi:

    # btattach -B /dev/ttyAMA0 -P bcm -S 921600 -N
    Attaching Primary controller to /dev/ttyAMA0
    Failed set serial line discipline: Device or resource busy
    No controller attached


Oh! We have `dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt` in config.txt (should read through
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md sometime and
see if it makes sense). This command works:

    # btattach -B /dev/ttyS0 -P bcm -S 921600 -N
    Attaching Primary controller to /dev/ttyS0
    Switched line discipline from 0 to 15
    Device index 0 attached


Removing `dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt` from `config.txt`, rebooting, and:

    # btattach -B /dev/ttyAMA0 -P bcm -S 921600 -N
    # /usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd
    # bluetoothctl
    Agent registered
