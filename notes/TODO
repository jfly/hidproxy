### TODO

- Figure out how to build rust code + run code on boot
   - https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot/commit/?id=b50522d838d8ddfef80bf8036e511319982da16e
   - https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5apj6v/buildroot_and_embedded_rust/
   - this looks like promising instructions: http://www.elebihan.com/posts/how-to-add-a-buildroot-package-for-a-cargo-crate.html
- Raspberry PI gpio? one-wire protocol?
- Figure out a better way of naming devices. Should we ask the user for a
   name? Should we autogenerate one and print it out clearly?
   - For now: need to update `BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_HOSTNAME` in `out/.config` and
   - `buildroot-external/thermometer/overlay/etc/network/interfaces`
- Set up a read-only rootfs?
- Maybe add a non-root user + sudo? Then we could remove the custom sshd configuration.
- OTA updates (swupdate looks like a tool some people use)
- Why are sshd *and* dropbear both trying to start?
